## Introduction

This is a NPM module to aid with embedding the Quill editor in [Stripes](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-core/) applications for building templates with token substitution.

## Attribution

@skomorokh extracted this from ui-circulation in [this commit](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-circulation/commit/ead94d580d7e0be4e8b9f17d9fc99a2e43fb8cae). The code was largely written by @maximdidenkoepam and @skomorokh probably should have made more of an effort to bring the commit history along. However, you can view it at the originating module.
